                <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>
                <p>I am writing to express my interest in the <strong>Software Engineer</strong> position at your company. With a strong background in <em>computer science</em> and hands-on experience in building scalable applications, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am pursuing my <span>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering</span> at <strong>Western Governors University</strong>, expected to graduate in <strong>December 2025</strong>. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained proficiency in a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and C++. I have also developed multiple projects, including web applications, machine learning tools, and mobile apps, which showcase my technical abilities.</p>

                <p>In my most recent internship at <strong>TechNova Inc.</strong>, I worked closely with a team of developers to create <mark>RESTful APIs</mark> and integrate them into various front-end applications. My contributions helped enhance the user experience and optimize system performance.</p>

                <p>I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and thrive in fast-paced environments. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills to your team and contribute to your company's success.</p>

                <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experiences align with your needs.</p>
